# minishell_tester

## Launch
`bash tester.sh`

## Test
First of all, the tester check the `norm`  
And then, it'll `make` the project if it's not already done  

## Result
If the output is correct, a simple `success` per test should output on your terminal  
Else, you will see the correct output in `Expected output` and yours in `Your output`
